# ðŸŒ¾ Smart Farming Prototype â€“ Pest & Fungal Threat Mitigation

This smart farming prototype was developed to address **pest and fungal threats** commonly affecting Egyptian crops. It offers an automated, eco-friendly solution through real-time detection and response mechanisms.

## ðŸŒ¿ Key Features

- **Infrared Sensing**  
  Detects anomalies in plant health and pest movement.
  
- **Soil Moisture Monitoring**  
  Identifies potential fungal growth conditions based on soil humidity.

- **Automated Pesticide Spraying**  
  Activates sprayers to release **eco-friendly neem oil** when pest activity or fungal risk is detected.

- **Enhanced Soil Mix**  
  Utilizes a custom blend of **peat moss and perlite**, shown to:
  - Improve crop yield
  - Enhance soil aeration
  - Outperform traditional soil mixtures in tests

## ðŸ”§ Hardware Components

- **Arduino Board**
- **Soil Mixture**: Peat moss + Perlite
- **Soil Moisture Sensor** â€“ Detects early signs of fungal conditions
- **Thermistor** â€“ Monitors soil temperature
- **PIR Sensor (Passive Infrared)** â€“ Detects pest motion
- **Neem Oil** â€“ Natural pesticide and fungicide
- **Relay Modules** â€“ Controls sprayers based on sensor triggers
- **Sprayers** â€“ Dispense neem oil automatically
